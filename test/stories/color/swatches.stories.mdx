# Swatches

There are different “levels” of tints and shades for each color that are used on a scale from 0-1000, with the base level of each color at the `500` level. The tints of each color get lighter as they get closer to `0` (white), and shades get darker as they get closer to `1000` (black). Some of these levels will be more commonly used than others, and we often use the `300` level as a light version of the color (as in “light blue”), and the `700` level as a dark version (as in “dark blue”).

Additionally there is a set of semantic names for color related functions which map back to certainnumbered  color properties/variables to easily use common values.

```css
/* --color-primary may map to --blue-500 */
p {
  color: var(--color-primary);
}
```

See `color/base-variables.css` for reference
